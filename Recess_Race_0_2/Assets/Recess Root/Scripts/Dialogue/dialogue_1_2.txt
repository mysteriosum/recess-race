MEANWHILE, on the other side of the race...

HILL: So, Phyllis: have you heard the news?

PHYLLIS: What? No! I have been away. Tell me!

HILL: Oh, it's wonderful, really. Mostly. Partly it's awful, but mostly it's wonderful. 

PHYLLIS: Enticing! You have my full attention.

HILL: Wait till you hear. Are you ready?

PHYLLIS: Yes! Out with it, woman!

HILL: All right. Carol... is being fired.

PHYLLIS: Ah.

HILL: Carol? Did you hear me? I said Carol won't be working here any more.

PHYLLIS: Yeah, I heard you.

HILL: In fact I think that's why Mme De Bourgh is over there talking to her now. Pretty great eh?

PHYLLIS: Yes, yes it is...

HILL: It's awful for Carol of course, you know, her father is going to be livid. I've heard her talk about him. He's rich, you know. She was on an allowance until she turned 25, and after that he insisted she get a job. She didn't for five years, living on what she had left, or staying with friends. She thought she could wait long enough for her father to cave, but he never did. That's why she's here! I don't want to be in her shoes. I'm just happy I won't have to hear her mock my clothes again!

PHYLLIS: Yes...

HILL: Well, barrel of laughs you are. I thought you'd be more excited about this, but, well, what do I know.

PHYLLIS: I'm sorry. It is really a nice juicy piece.

HILL: Right you are!

PHYLLIS: I suppose we'd better keep watching the race.

HILL: Hmph! Something crawl up your spine today?

PHYLLIS: No, I just think we'd better watch the race.

HILL: Oh, well, have it your way.

[they continue watching the race]
