#Scene 4, in which Carol and Phyllis are reconciled.
#[Phylls and Carol are standing in the school yard, discussing previous events: how Phyllis sabotaged Carol, how she was fired, how Phyllis talked Mr. Bennett into rehiring Carol, and how Carol got her job back.]
PHYLLIS: Hello Carol.
CAROL: Hi.
PAUSE: 50
PHYLLIS: I’m sorry.
CAROL: I beg your pardon?
PHYLLIS: I said I’m sorry.
CAROL: For what?
PHYLLIS: For… everything.  You... don’t know?
CAROL: I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I think you’d better explain it.
PHYLLIS: I thought they would have told you. What did they say when they rehired you?
CAROL: They said they discussed it more at length, and decided it was an impulsive decision, and to give me a second chance. What should they have told me?
PHYLLIS: I… um…
CAROL: Well?
PHYLLIS: It was me who sabotaged your lunch.
CAROL: You… you what?!
PHYLLIS: I put the… gross thing in your lunch. On that day.
CAROL: I see.
PHYLLIS: Yes…
PAUSE: 5
CAROL: So it was because of you that I was dismissed.
PAUSE: 1
PHYLLIS: Yes.
CAROL: And no one knew it was you?
PHYLLIS: Well I told Jane a couple of days ago, and she told me to tell Mr. Bennett...
CAROL: So you could have just done nothing.
PHYLLIS: Y-yes, I could have. I thought about it.
CAROL: Why didn't you just let me get fired?
PHYLLIS: I...
CAROL:  I can't even remember a kind word between us.
PHYLLIS: Yes, but you never got me fired! I never wanted for that to happen. I couldn't sleep all week. Especially, Hill told me about your family situation, and I couldn't stop imagining your father...
CAROL: (a short laugh) I never told my father.
PHYLLIS: Oh.
CAROL: I couldn't face him. Whatever you imagined, it would have been worse. You must understand, the way I've treated you is the way he treats anyone without a six-digit salary. I'm afraid I've inherited many of my father's worst aspects. 
PAUSE: 4
CAROL: I thought about you a lot this week.
PHYLLIS: Really?
CAROL: When I thought about how my father would react, and how he does when I do anything he doesn't like, I thought about how I've treated you. Spending the day home alone left me lots of time to think.
PHYLLIS: I see.
CAROL: I deserved what you did.
PHYLLIS: No, you didn't, no one does.
CAROL: I did. 
PHYLLIS: I should have just told you how I felt. I was a coward.
CAROL: Look... what happened is in the past now.
PHYLLIS: So... you forgive me?
CAROL: Will you forgive me?
PHYLLIS: Of course.
CAROL: Then we're even.
PHYLLIS: OK. Good.
CAROL: ... Thank you.
PHYLLIS: Thank you!
#[The two resume watching the race. After a moment, Carol smirks and nudges Phyllis]
PAUSE: 3
CAROL: Actually, I take all that back. You damn well owe me!
PHYLLIS: Owe you what?!
CAROL: I dunno yet. I'll figure something out. Revenge maybe. I promise I won't get you fired, but I can't promise anything else!
#[They both laugh. AND THE RACE GOES ON!...Though at this point you've clearly lost if you watched this whole convo!
