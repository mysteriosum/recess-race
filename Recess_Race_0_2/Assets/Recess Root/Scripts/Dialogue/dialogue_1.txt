#SCENE THE FIRST, in which Carol is chewed out and eventually fired by Madame de Bourgh.

DE BOURGH: Carol, I am most seriously displeased.

CAROL: I beg your pardon?

DE BOURGH: I see I will have to explain everything to you. Were you aware a child was injured two days ago during after-school hours?

CAROL: No.

DE BOURGH: I should imagine not - since you were not at your post.

CAROL: What?

DE BOURGH: A child, who shall remain nameless until we are in private, was injured on your watch. When he returned home, he explained this to his parents. They spoke to me yesterday evening and explained what the boy told them. You will not like what they had to say.

CAROL: Please, Mme De Bourgh, there are people - 

DE BOURGH: I will not be interrupted! You, apparently, could not wait to eat your dinner until the proper hour, but mishandled your food and spilled the stuff on your clothing, after which you were gone for twenty minutes, without informing any staff nor seeking a replacement. Do you deny this has transpired?

CAROL: It wasn't exactly like that, I - 

DE BOURGH: Did you, or did you not, leave your post for twenty minutes without providing adequate care for the children?

CAROL: I... I did, but - 

DE BOURGH: I need hardly tell you what sort of offence this is. Your primary duty as monitor is to monitor the children. You clearly cannot function properly in this capacity.

CAROL: Please, won't you - 

DE BOURGH: I will hear no excuse. This shift will be your last.

CAROL: But I'm in the union, you can't just - 

DE BOURGH: I have already spoken to your union. They agree that it is inescapable, and that you must be made an example of.

CAROL: ...

DE BOURGH: Any questions?

CAROL: No.

DE BOURGH: Good day, Miss Carol.
